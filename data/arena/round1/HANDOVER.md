# Round <N> handover

A template, filled in during the round and finished by deadline − 0:10. Copy it to `data/arena/round<N+1>/` for
the next round. Committed and pushed so the other laptop has it (ON_THE_DAY.md, "Handover note"); the private
run's results and `leaderboard.json` go in this folder too.

## Uploaded
<!-- each upload: file, time, why; local PnL under all / worse / --resting; the metrics expected (arena.backtest --metrics) -->

## Portal against local
<!-- the portal's figures against our backtest of the same file on the same days; the ratio (T); which fill mode and mark fit -->

## Private run against public
<!-- the private (hidden) run's PnL against the public one, per product -->

## Fill model and mark
<!-- the engine settings that matched the portal: --resting/--queue, --match-trades, --mark, --limit-penalty, --fee -->

## Units map
<!-- exchange unit → engine unit (1 / PRICE_SCALE) → each product's tick; their timestamps → 0..999,900; where each limit comes from -->

## Rule answers
<!-- which ON_THE_DAY.md items the rules or probes answered (written under each item, with the source), and the ones still open -->

## Re-tests
<!-- which of last round's choices were tested again this round, which were kept untested ("Choose the approach again each round") -->

## Leaderboard
<!-- leaderboard.json saved here; experiments.day.leaderboard_curves --read verdict; our standing -->

## Next round
<!-- round N+1's first candidate, and its first three actions -->
