"""Does anything predict the price? An extra feed against the wall mid, then a linear forecast from the book and the flow.

usage (from the repo root): uv run python -m experiments.predict [--part 1|2]

1. **A feed beyond the book** (an audit's idea 5; references/wiki: a fair term, not a forecast).
   Prosperity keeps one: P3 round 4's observations file (the foreign bid and ask, transport fees,
   tariffs, sugar price and sunlight index, for MAGNIFICENT_MACARONS), which arena.formats.prosperity
   doesn't load (the bot's state gets an empty Observation), so it is read here from the data folder:
   every `<kind>_round_R_day_D.csv` beside the prices and trades (a file with a `product` column
   applies to that product, one without to every --products). For each numeric column that moves
   within a day, against the product's wall mid:
     - its one-tick change against the wall mid's change at the same tick, and against the wall mid's
       move 1, 5, 20 and 100 ticks ahead (a lead), the mean correlation over the days and whether
       every day has its sign (*);
     - a leave-one-day-out fit of the wall mid's change over h ticks on the feed's change over the
       same h (through 0; non-overlapping windows): b, and its out-of-sample R². That is the fair
       term `fair += b × (feed − its level when the fair was last set)`, same tick, not a forecast;
     - an event study: around the feed's largest one-tick changes (above EVENT_QUANTILE of its
       non-zero changes), the wall mid's mean move in the change's direction from the tick before,
       at offsets −20 to +100 ticks: how much of it comes before, at, and after the change.
   On ABIDES's days the one extra file is the fundamental, the answer key no bot sees: it is read
   as a feed all the same, as an upper bound on what a feed could do.
2. **A linear forecast** (edge_ideas item 6): leave one day out, a ridge regression of the wall
   mid's move 1, 5, 20 and 100 ticks ahead (in ticks) on ρ and ρ3 (python/experiments/imbalance.py's
   imbalance and depth_imbalance), its flows (adds, removals, OFI, signed trades), the wall mid's
   momentum over 1, 5, 20 and 100 ticks, the time of day, and every other product's 5-tick return.
   Features standardised on the training days, penalty RIDGE × the training rows. Per held-out day
   and pooled: the out-of-sample R², the move one sd of the forecast predicts (the slope of the move
   on the forecast × the forecast's sd) against the half-spread, and Sitaru et al.'s rule
   (references/wiki/sources/decomposed-ofi.md): trade only when the forecast beats half the spread
   at that tick; the mean move in the forecast's direction less that half-spread on those ticks,
   per day, and the share of ticks it trades. The trigger for a `linear` fair in the template is a
   move per sd above the half-spread with R² > 0 on every held-out day (IDEAS.md, "A `linear` fair").

Default: part 1 on P3 round 4 (MAGNIFICENT_MACARONS), part 2 on P3 round 1 and P4 rounds 1-2.
