"""A standings calculator for the last round: our rank distribution after it, under each way the
rounds may combine, for each scale of our bot's risk, and the relative hedge that best keeps our place.

usage (from the repo root):
  uv run python -m experiments.standings --rounds data/arena/round1/leaderboard.json data/arena/round2/leaderboard.json \\
      data/arena/round3/leaderboard.json --team NAME --ours results/grid.csv [--where PARAMS.P.KEY=V] [--days-per-round N]
  uv run python -m experiments.standings --synthetic     # a synthetic field (IDEAS.md, "A standings calculator for round 4")

Qminers' 2024 winner simulated the final against rivals with weaker, correlated models, picked the
stake with the most first places, and halved it in the last round while far ahead
(references/wiki/concepts/risk-and-protecting-a-lead.md). This does that from the leaderboards.

Inputs:
  --rounds   each round's leaderboard as the page receives it (experiments.leaderboard_curves'
             layout: rank, teamName, isTie, pnl, pnlSeries of elapsedS and pnl), rounds 1..R in order.
  --team     our team's name on them.
  --ours     our PnL distribution in round R+1, from backtests on its data: numbers (1200,1500,...),
             a file of numbers, or an arena.grid --out CSV (its per-day PnL under the first mode, of
             the row --where picks, else the best by that mode's PnL). Its mean and sd, times
             --days-per-round (sum of that many days), are our round's PnL at risk multiplier 1.

The next round, simulated --sims times (seeded):
  - every other team's PnL is median + sd × (ρ·skill + √(1−ρ²)·(√c·b·F + √(1−c·b²)·e)), with the
    median and sd of the last round's PnL (× --growth), skill the team's mean z-score over the rounds
    so far (standardised), ρ how well the earlier rounds' mean predicted the last round's (the
    persistence), F the field's bet (one draw a simulation, shared by every team) and e the team's own
    luck. c, the field's bet's share of a team's variance, and b, each team's loading on it (mean 1),
    are read from the last round's curves: the field's bet is the mean of the teams' PnL changes,
    b a team's regression on it, c its variance over the mean team's (no curves: c 0, b 1).
  - ours is k^p × mean + k × sd × η + (h + our loading) × the field's bet's PnL for a team of
    loading 1 + h × --hedge-edge: k is the risk multiplier (make_size, stop_loss, bets on or off),
    scaling the mean and sd together unless --mean-power p is below 1 (a larger size that fills less
    per lot, a bet with a thin edge), h the relative hedge, the share of the field's bet we hold although we
    don't trade it for its own sake (Frankfurt Hedgehogs kept mean-reversion exposure they no longer
    believed in because several top teams traded only that; ON_THE_DAY.md, "How is PnL scored?").

The rounds combine in four ways, since the Technical Rules aren't out: PnL summed; PnL weighted
(--weights, the site's unconfirmed 10/20/30/40%); and each round's PnL over the round's largest
|PnL| (a score that doesn't let the biggest round's scale decide), weighted and equal. For each:
our rank now, then after the next round for each k (the hedge at 0) and each h (at --k), as the
mean rank, the chance of 1st, of the top 3, and of losing a place (a worse rank than now).
