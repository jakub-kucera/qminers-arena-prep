"""Does the best-level imbalance predict the price on Prosperity data? Gould & Bonart's test, per product and day.

usage (from the repo root): uv run python -m experiments.imbalance
       uv run python -m experiments.imbalance --data DIR --days 1 2 [--format F --products A,B]

The imbalance is `ρ = (Vᵇ − Vᵃ)/(Vᵇ + Vᵃ)` at the best bid and ask
(references/wiki/concepts/book-imbalance-and-micro-price.md). For each product of the
market-making rounds (DATASETS), three tests:

1. Gould & Bonart: at each tick where the mid changes, `y` = up, against `ρ` one tick before.
   A logistic regression `P(up) = 1/(1 + e^-(x0 + x1 ρ))`, fitted leaving one day out. Reports
   the ROC area and the drop in squared error against a coin flip (0.25), out of sample, the
   sign of `x1` fitted on each day alone, and the same split by spread (in ticks).
2. Fair value: how well each candidate at tick t predicts the wall mid (the market maker's
   price, which the template trades back at) and the mid (Prosperity's mark) H ticks later.
   Root mean squared error, pooled over the days. Candidates: mid, wall_mid, sized_mid (15),
   the weighted mid `W = I·Pᵃ + (1 − I)·Pᵇ` with `I = Vᵇ/(Vᵇ + Vᵃ)`, and `wall_mid + b·ρ`
   with `b` fitted by least squares leaving one day out (the linear micro-price), the same with ρ
   over the best DEPTH levels (`wall_mid + b·ρ3`, added 2026-10-26 after section 4), and
   `wall_mid + G(ρ, spread)`, Stoikov's form: the mean move in each of 5 ρ buckets × the spread
   buckets, also leaving one day out (the micro-price's table at horizon H, without his
   symmetrising or Markov-chain step, so it can only fit better in sample).
3. The fitted `b` per day, in ticks per unit of ρ, at each horizon: a stable sign and size is
   what a `PARAMS` entry would need.
4. Order flow (Cont et al.'s OFI, decomposed as Sitaru et al. do) and how far ahead each signal
   reads: between consecutive snapshots, the best levels' **adds** (a bid queue growing or a new
   higher bid, less the same at the ask) and **removals** (an ask queue shrinking or the best ask
   gone up, less the same at the bid), their sum the OFI, and the tick's **trades** (signed market
   volume, classified against its own book as arena.diagnose does), next to ρ and the depth
   imbalance over the best 3 levels (ρ3). Each at tick t against the wall mid's and the mid's change
   from t to t + h, for h in FLOW_HORIZONS: the correlation averaged over the days, whether every
   day has its sign, and the move one standard deviation of the signal predicts, in ticks. Prosperity's
   trades don't line up with the book's changes (the generator redraws the book each tick), so
   removals can't be split into cancels and trades as on an order-by-order feed.
Results go into IDEAS.md ("The micro-price or weighted mid as fair value", "Book imbalance",
"Order flow decomposed, and how far ahead it reads").

With --data (the day's download) every product there (or --products) is studied on those days;
prices stay in the data's unit, and the spread is in each product's ticks (Day.info).
