Why: the engine replays a recording, so the market never reacts to our orders. The Arena's
simulator may: a take moves the price, the market maker skews against the flow it receives, and
the private run is a seed we never see (references/wiki/concepts/harder-rounds.md, A1). This is
the smallest such market the literature describes (PyMarketSim; Wang & Wellman 2017; ABIDES; see
their pages in references/wiki/sources/). Per product, every tick:

  1. The fundamental moves. It reverts to a level at rate `reversion` (Wang & Wellman's eq. 1
     without the floor at 0), with Gaussian steps, an optional drift, and jumps that may snap back
     after a while, or come in bursts that mostly reverse the jump before. With a regime change (`with_regime`, `--regime`), from a point in
     the day the value and its level shift at once, or both start to trend.
  2. The quoters arrive and post, against the live book:
       - the market maker re-quotes its walls around its view of the fundamental, moved against
         its inventory (`skew`), so after it is hit it quotes worse (A3);
       - limit traders post small orders a few ticks from their view of the fundamental and
         cancel them after `life` ticks; a price that crosses the book takes instead.
  3. The book is snapshotted, three levels a side as in Prosperity's files. In `run`, bots see
     the snapshot and trade: their orders take from the book at once, and the rest waits.
  4. The takers arrive in a seeded random order, with price-time priority against the book,
     the bots' orders included. Their trades are this tick's market trades:
       - noise takers buy or sell a few lots at the touch for no reason, the sides possibly
         unequal in number and size, and possibly repeating the last noise taker's side;
       - value takers see the fundamental with noise and take when the touch is far enough off;
       - momentum takers buy when the mid's short average is above its long one, and sell below.

Seeding follows ABIDES: one master seed, one generator per product and agent kind, so a run
repeats exactly. Each arrival makes the same draws whatever the book shows, so adding a bot
changes only what the agents meet, never what they draw: a day with the bot and the recording
without it share every random number.

This is the order a Prosperity tick implies: its trades print against its book, and the replay
engine fills the bot's tick-t orders from them. So a recorded day replays with the same
semantics, and the gap between replaying it and running the bot in the market is the market's
reaction to the bot, not a change of rules.

Bots in the market follow the replay engine's two modes:
  - default: an order takes what it can at once, then stays for that tick's takers only, then is
    cancelled;
  - resting: it stays until filled or cancelled (unless ioc), with a real place in the queue.
Limits are checked as in the engine, every order for a product rejected if all its buys or all its
sells could breach. A bot's orders never trade with each other. Standard library only.
