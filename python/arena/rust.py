"""The Rust port (rust/) from Python: building it, exporting days for it, and running backtests on it.

rust/ ports python/arena/engine.py and some bots, each with its Python twin listed in rust/twins.json
(rust/README.md has the table of what is in which language). This module is the bridge:

  export_day    a Day as rust/src/support/dayfile.rs reads it (the format plug-ins stay in Python)
  write_day     a reference to a Prosperity day's own CSVs instead, which Rust reads itself
                (rust/src/arena/formats/prosperity.rs), when the day came from them; else export_day
  bot_spec      a twin bot for Rust: its kind, and its Python file's globals after any --set
                overrides, so the Rust bot reads the same settings (the template's DEFAULTS and
                PARAMS, a rival's constants)
  prepare       --engine rust's checks: bots with a twin for the format, twins checked since their
                Python code changed (--allow-stale to run anyway), a built binary; require for an experiment
  run_days      `arena-rs run`: participants in one market on each day, on threads, back as Python
                DayResults (arena.backtest --engine rust)
  run_batch     `arena-rs batch`: many backtests on every core, each returning what arena.grid's
                Piece holds (arena.grid, arena.compare, arena.stress --engine rust)
  run_sim       `arena-rs sim`: arena.sim's market (rust/src/arena/sim.rs) on a range of seeds, with twin
                bots in it, read back as arena.sim.SimDay (arena.sim --engine rust)
  cscv, mean_correlation, snooping
                python/arena/stats.py's statistics that grow with a grid's cells, in rust/src/arena/stats.rs
                (arena.grid --engine rust): the same results to the bit
  read_day, read_results
                a day and DayResults as Rust wrote them, back as Python's own types, so the reports
                and CSVs work unchanged
  stale_twins   the twins whose Python file changed since the Rust port was last checked against it

Standard library only, like the rest of python/arena/ outside analysis.py. Nothing here is needed unless
a tool is asked for the Rust engine.
