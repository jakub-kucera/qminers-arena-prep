"""First-look diagnostics of a market's data, per product: what kind of market is this?

    uv run python -m arena.diagnose 1 --data p4        # every day of round 1
    uv run python -m arena.diagnose 3-0 --data p4 --csv results/diag.csv
    uv run python -m arena.diagnose 1 --data p3 --profile   # ...and each product by tenth of the day
    uv run python -m arena.diagnose 1 --data p4 --suggest   # ...and a PARAMS block for the template, from the notes

No bot is needed: it reads the days through the format plug-in, so it works on the Arena's
first data download as soon as its format module exists. For each product, pooled over the days:

- **Book:** the tick, the spread in ticks, the share of two-sided ticks at a one-tick spread (the
  large-tick regime, where queue position and book imbalance matter), how often one side of the
  book is empty, and how often the wall mid jumps: moves by more than half the spread (and at
  least a tick) from one tick to the next. Where orders rest, quotes near the touch of a product
  that jumps get filled at their stale price.
- **The market maker's size:** the median size of each side's largest level, and the share of
  sides with a level of at least `WALL_SIZE` lots, the template's default `wall_size`. Where that
  share is low, `sized_mid` falls back to the best level, i.e. the plain mid, on most ticks.
- **Jumps that snap back:** the wall mid's moves of at least `SNAP_SPREADS` times the day's median
  spread, and the share that went the opposite way to the one before. Where that share is high,
  fading each jump pays (the template's `jump` mode); elsewhere it is a coin flip. The note gives
  the jumps' usual size (their median), the share that is exactly that size, and the grid the wall
  mid sits on: the share of ticks at its most common value modulo that size (P4 round 5's
  ROBOT_DISHES: steps of 100 between multiples of 100). The template's `jump_min` is about half the size.
- **Large-tick market making** (Gao & Wang 2018, Theorem 4.1(c)): on the ticks at a one-tick
  spread, `λ` is the share after which the mid moves, and `λ+` (`λ-`) the share with a market buy
  at the ask (sell at the bid) after which it does not: the uninformed hits. In their model a quote
  at the best has a positive value on a side iff `λ±` > `λ/2`, since a fill there gains half a tick
  at rate `λ±` and loses half a tick when the mid jumps through it, at rate `λ/2`. A large-tick
  product gets a note saying on which sides that holds.
- **Spoofability** (Tao et al. 2022, Proposition 3.3 and eq. 5.1): a spoof pays only if the next
  move follows the book's imbalance, the real order is large next to the depth, and a level k deep
  is rarely reached by market orders. With `ı = B/(B + A)`, the bid's share of the volume on the
  best `SPOOF_LEVELS` levels (equal weights `w_k`): `µ+` is the slope of the mid's next move, in
  ticks, on `2ı - 1` over ticks without market trades (their `µ(ı) = µ+(2ı - 1)`); each tick's
  market buys (sells) are one order of size `H`, `y` the levels it empties (their `F(H)`), and
  `Q_k` and `ν_k` the share of orders with `y > k` and the mean of `(y - k)+`; `ρ` is the orders'
  mean size over the mean depth on the side they hit, and `ı̄` the mean imbalance after them (the
  sells' mirrored). The score is `max_k 2ρµ+(1 - ı̄)ı̄w_k - Q_kρ - ν_k`: above 0, a spoof at some
  depth k pays in their model; at or below 0, nowhere.
- **Noise:** the lag-1 autocorrelation of one-tick changes of the mid, and the signature ratio of
  the mid and of the wall mid (the midpoint of the largest level on each side): the variance per
  tick of one-tick changes over that of `LAG`-tick changes. Near 1 is a random walk; well above 1
  is noise that reverts, which a fair value should filter out.
- **Kalman-implied smoothing:** a local-level model, the price a random walk of step variance `q`
  seen through noise of variance `r`, has `E[(p[t+h] - p[t])^2] = h q + 2 r`. A least-squares line
  through the mean squared change at each of `KALMAN_LAGS` gives `q` (its slope) and `r` (half its
  intercept), per reference. The steady-state Kalman filter for that model is an EMA with gain
  `K = P / (P + r)`, `P = (q + sqrt(q^2 + 4 q r)) / 2` (the predicted variance), so the template's
  `smoothing` (`fair = s * previous + (1 - s) * price`) that matches it is `1 - K`. Noise that
  reverts at one tick (a bouncing mid) gives a high `r`; a random walk gives `r` near 0 and 0.
  The fit takes each day's mean change out. An EMA lags a drift `mu` a tick by `mu s / (1 - s)`, so
  where the days drift the column is the `s` that minimises the EMA's steady-state squared error,
  `(mu s / (1 - s))^2 + (s^2 q + (1 - s)^2 r) / (1 - s^2)`, which is `1 - K` when `mu` is 0.
- **Slow reversion:** the wall mid's variance per tick at `LAG` ticks over that at `LONG_LAG`
  ticks. Well above 1: the price returns to a level over hundreds of ticks, which the lag-1
  numbers can't see.
- **Drift:** the wall mid's change over each day, and that change over the day's noise.
- **Market trades:** each classified against its own tick's book, as `analysis.trade_impact` does
  (+1 at or above the best ask, -1 at or below the best bid; inside the spread: left out). Then:
  - the share of buys and `C(1)`, the correlation of consecutive trade signs;
  - against each reference (the mid, the wall mid): the taker's edge `sign × (ref − price)` and
    the signed move `R(h) = sign × (ref[t+h] − ref[t])` after 1 and `LAG` ticks;
  - the two margins per unit of a market maker who takes the other side, from Bouchaud et al.
    (2018), eqs. 17.13–17.14: slow `−edge − R(LAG)` and fast `−edge × (1 − C(1)) − R(1)`. The
    book writes `s/2` for `−edge`, which is the same against the mid when trades are at the touch;
    measuring it keeps the margin consistent with the reference.
- **Time of day:** the spread, the wall mid's mean move a tick and the market trades per 1,000
  ticks in each tenth of the day (`PARTS`), pooled over the days. When the first or the last tenth
  is `PROFILE_RATIO` times the middle's median, or less than its inverse, the notes say so: an open
  that is wider or faster than the day is a reason to quote wider there, a close that is to flatten
  earlier (`flatten_from`). `--profile` prints the whole table.
- **`--suggest`:** a PARAMS entry per product for the template, read off the notes as the wiki's
  day-one table says (see `suggest`): a starting point for the first backtest and grid, not a
  tuned setting. `python/experiments/suggest_check.py` scores it against the hand-tuned PARAMS.
- **Notes:** which regime the numbers point to, using the thresholds below. They are rules of
  thumb calibrated on Prosperity data, not verdicts.
  `references/wiki/concepts/reading-the-data-on-day-one.md` says what each one means for the
  strategy.
