The Arena's private run may not look like the download: Qminers' 2024 final switched regime, and
a fixed anchor or a level set from the download breaks when the price moves away for good
(references/wiki/concepts/harder-rounds.md, B1). Each perturbation moves a product's whole book,
its market trades and its mark by the same offset at a tick, so the book's shape and the trades'
place in it are kept; only the price path changes. Sizes are in the product's median spread `s`
over the day, times `--size`, and every offset is a whole number of the product's ticks:

    vol2         every tick's distance from the day's first wall mid is doubled
    trend_up     a steady drift adding up to 10 s over the day (trend_down: down)
    shift_up     the price moves 5 s at the middle of the day and stays (shift_down: down)
    spike_up     the price moves 5 s at the middle of the day and comes back 100 ticks later
    no_wall      for the middle fifth of the day the largest level on each side is gone

`permute(day, seed, block)` is a different kind of copy, for arena.grid's permutation test: the
day's own ticks in a shuffled order, in runs of `block` ticks, each shifted so the price continues
by the move it had in the real day. Each tick's book, its trades' place in it, the products'
ticks together and the day's net move are kept; anything that depends on the order of ticks
longer than a run (mean reversion, trends, a level the price returns to, a signal that leads the
price) is gone.

It prints each product's PnL on the plain day and under each perturbation, summed over the days,
its largest intraday drawdown on a plain day (what a loss stop must leave room for), and its worst
single (day, perturbation). The template's loss stop and regime guard are judged by that last
column (`stop_loss` in python/bots/template.py: no product should lose much more than its stop).
